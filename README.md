# iRobot-algorithm-simulation
a path-finding &amp; exploration algorithm simulations - for an iRobot home vacuum.

##Simulation:
This is a frame-work to simulate different algorithms running on an iRobot to clean a house.
The algo. will compete in a chalange to clean the house in the *least steps*.

##Algorithm:
Given a new .house map, The algorithm will explore the space and plan the best route to clean the house.

Utilizing: *Maze-routing algorithm, Pledge algorithm*
